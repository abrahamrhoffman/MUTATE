# mutate
Distributed Neuroevolution

This library is a brand-spanking-new implementation of <a href = "http://www.cs.ucf.edu/~kstanley/">Kenneth O. Stanley's</a> neuroevolution algorithm NEAT. NEAT (Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies) is a novel method for modelling Neural Networks. The primary benefit of using this library is that it distributes either the model or data (depending on your choice of parallelism).

<i>This library is under active development.</i>
